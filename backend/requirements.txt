# Me-API Playground
A FastAPI + SQLModel based backend (with simple frontend) to showcase my profile, projects, skills, and work experience.  
This project was built as part of a backend assessment.

---


- REST API exposing:
  - `/api/profile` → My profile (name, email, education, links).
  - `/api/skills` → All skills.
  - `/api/skills/top` → Skills ranked by usage in projects.
  - `/api/projects` → List of projects (filter by skill).
  - `/api/projects/{id}` → Single project with skills.
  - `/api/work` → Work experiences.
  - `/api/search?q=...` → Search projects & skills.
- Basic authentication for write operations (`X-API-Key` header).
- SQLite database with auto-seeding from my resume.
- CORS enabled (frontend + backend integration).

## 🏗 Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI + SQLModel + SQLite (deployed on Render).
